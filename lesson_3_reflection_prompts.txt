When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 You are working on more than one computer (home/work).
 Collaborating with others.
 You want an offsite backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You wouldn't want an automatic update to clobber something you're working on.
